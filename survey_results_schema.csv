On that note, throughout the survey, certain answers you and your peers give will be treated as personally identifiable information, and therefore kept out of the anonymized results file.  The information gathered via this survey is made available to the public in the spirit of community which Stack Overflow was founded and to serve as a resource for everyone who codes. </div><div><br></div><div>By selecting ""I agree"" and submitting this survey, you acknowledge that you voluntarily consent to your anonymous answers being made publicly available.
